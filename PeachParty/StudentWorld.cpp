//    game world as described below.

//    winning player.
//    c. If Peach won, return GWSTATUS_PEACH_WON. If Yoshi won, return
//    GWSTATUS_YOSHI_WON. If the game was a tie game, pick a winner randomly
//    and return one of the above return values.
//    2. It must ask all of the actors that are currently active in the game world to do
//    something (e.g., ask each Bowser to move itself, ask each Vortex projectile to
//    check if it overlaps with a baddie, and if so, teleport the baddie to a random
//    square, give Peach and Yoshi both a chance to move, roll, or shoot a Vortex, etc.).
//    3. It must then delete any actors that have become inactive/dead during this tick
//    (e.g., a Vortex that flies off the screen and needs to be removed from the game).
//    4. It must update the status text on the top of the screen with the latest information
//    (e.g., each player's stats).
//    5. If the game is not over, then the function must return GWSTATUS_CONTINUE_GAME.
